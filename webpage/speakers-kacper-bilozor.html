                        <h6>
                            Workshop language: English
                        </h6>

                        <h4>Giving speeches on a regular basis is just not enough.</h4>
                        <p>
                            In order to develop one’s full potential, one needs to ask for,
                            receive, and apply feedback. This is why speech evaluation is the
                            cornerstone of the Toastmasters experience. The unfortunate reality is
                            that evaluators either deliver mostly praise with few meaningful
                            suggestions or they provide the speaker with of a multitude of minor
                            hacks and tweaks. This leaves the guests and audiences confused as to
                            the true value of the speech and the speaker unmotivated to rethink
                            his or hers approach to speech building.
                        </p>

                        <h4>So, how can we become better speakers and evaluators?</h4>
                        <p>
                            By watching and learning from TED Talks! So, drop your manuals,
                            handbooks, and evaluation sheets. And get ready for some serious
                            speech analysis.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The good news is: this can be done by sitting down at home with a cup
                            of your favourite beverage, turning on YouTube, and analysing speeches
                            that inspire audiences around the world. Simply put, maximum progress
                            with minimal cost (just your time!), without any meetings to attend
                            to, and without the hassle of finding a good and experienced speech
                            evaluator. On the 10th of May 2019 join me in Wrocław on the journey
                            of becoming a better speaker and better evaluator, as we will analyse
                            a TEDx speech… in real-time.
