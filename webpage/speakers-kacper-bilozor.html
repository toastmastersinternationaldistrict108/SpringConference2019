                        <h6>
                            Workshop language: English
                        </h6>

                        <p>
                        THE PROBLEM IS: <br /><br />
                        Giving speeches on a regular basis is just not enough.
                        In order to develop one’s full potential, one needs to ask for, receive, and apply feedback. This is why
                        speech evaluation is the cornerstone of the Toastmasters experience.
                        The unfortunate reality is that evaluators either deliver mostly praise with few meaningful suggestions
                        or they provide the speaker with of a multitude of minor hacks and tweaks. This leaves the guests and
                        audiences confused as to the true value of the speech and the speaker unmotivated to rethink his or
                        hers approach to speech building.
                        <br /><br />
                        THE QUESTION IS:<br /><br />
                        How can we become better speakers and evaluators?
                        <br /><br />
                        THE ANSWER:<br /><br />
                        Watching and learning from TED Talks!
                        So, drop your manuals, handbooks, and evaluation sheets.
                        And get ready for some serious speech analysis.
                        <br/><br/>THE GOOD NEWS IS:<br /><br />
                        This can be done by sitting down at home with a cup of your favourite beverage, turning on YouTube,
                        and analysing speeches that inspire audiences around the world.
                        Simply put, maximum progress with minimal cost (just your time!), without any meetings to attend to,
                        and without the hassle of finding a good and experienced speech evaluator.
                        On the 10th of May 2019 join me in Wrocław on the journey of becoming a better speaker and
                        better evaluator, as we will analyse a TEDx speech... in real-time.
